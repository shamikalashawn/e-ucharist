Communion, there's an app for that

This app was created by thoughtful, seminary-trained Christians passionate about connecting Godâ€™s people to the life of worship and the sacraments. We have sought to ground our work in scripture, tradition, and sound theology. We have not rushed into this process, nor taken this challenge lightly. We have done our best to create this app diligently and ethically on every level, and we hope that you will engage it through the vessel of your digital device as respectfully as you would the celebration of the Eucharist offline.
